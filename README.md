ZK Proof Library for Coinjoin transactions

## About

The **ZK Proof Coinjoin Library** is a Rust-based implementation designed to facilitate privacy-preserving Coinjoin transactions. Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques, including zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), this library aims to enhance the privacy and security of Bitcoin transactions by enabling multiple users to combine their coins into a single transaction without revealing their individual inputs.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implement zk-SNARKs to ensure that transaction details remain confidential while still allowing verification of the transaction's validity.
- **Multisig Support**: Enable multi-signature transactions to enhance security and ensure that multiple parties can participate in Coinjoin arrangements.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Facilitate secure communication between participants in a Coinjoin transaction, ensuring that user identities and transaction details are protected.
- **SegWit and Taproot Compatibility**: Support modern Bitcoin features like Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Taproot, enhancing flexibility and transaction efficiency.

### Use Cases

This library is suitable for developers looking to implement Coinjoin functionality in their Bitcoin applications, enabling users to enhance their privacy during transactions. It can be utilized in wallets, payment processors, and other Bitcoin-related applications.
